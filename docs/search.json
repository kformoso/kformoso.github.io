    "text": "The R-Ladies Buenos Aires workshop Transform Your Data into Visual Stories with Quarto presents an introduction to Quarto, an open-source publishing system designed to create dynamic and reproducible scientific and technical documents. It explores practical examples of its use in reproducible reports, covering topics such as integrating code and text, customizing output formats, and using parameters to create parameterized reports. This introductory workshop is aimed at individuals with a basic knowledge of R and little to no previous experience with Quarto.\nLearning Objectives:\n\nGet familiar with Quarto as a dynamic and reproducible publishing tool that expands the capabilities of RMarkdown.\nIdentify the possibilities it offers for creating scientific and technical documents, such as reports, presentations, and websites.\nLearn how to combine explanatory text with executable code to generate reports that automatically update results.\nUnderstand how to use parameters in Quarto to efficiently create different versions of the same document.\n\nFind recording and materials here."

To this end, we conducted an exploratory analysis of the evolution of the use of the terms “open science” and “open science” over time from 2012 to the present. Where information was available, the representation of each region was studied. Finally, a social network analysis was performed to identify influential users and clusters of users and then the association of these with communities of practice was studied.\nThe recording is available here.\nMore information can be found in this blogpost."

    "text": "In September 2023, I had the opportunity to attend the NumFocus DISC Unconference—a gathering dedicated to creating a more equitable open-source data science community. As someone committed to promoting open practices in research, data, and scientific computing in Latin America, this event offered a unique space to connect with leaders in these fields and work together on meaningful projects.\nThe open-source community remains relatively homogenous, which limits its potential. Events like the DISC Unconf provide a space to brainstorm how to make it more representative and inclusve. My role at the event was as a contributor, and I focused on a project that resonates deeply with my experiences as a researcher from the global south: Knowhow: everything you wanted to know about applying for grants but didn’t ask."

    "text": "Knowhow: everything you wanted to know about applying for grants but didn’t ask\nThis project aimed to tackle a critical barrier faced by researchers from underrepresented regions when applying for grants from the global north. For many of us, the application process often feels foreign and inaccessible due to cultural and systemic differences. These challenges discourage talented researchers from applying, perpetuating inequality in access to resources.\nThe project’s goal was to design a curriculum and coaching program to support potential grantees in navigating the grant process. From identifying suitable funding opportunities to crafting proposals, creating budgets, and building collaborations, the program seeks to level the playing field and enable fairer engagement.\nI collaborated with an incredible team, including Laura Ación, Jessica Greene, Barbara Wilk, Kate Hertweck, Yo Yehudi, Tania Allard, and Mariana Meireles. Working alongside individuals from diverse backgrounds was inspiring. Their varied perspectives challenged my thinking and enriched the project in ways I hadn’t anticipated."

I met leaders in the open-source world, learned about initiatives making these communities more accessible, and participated in a project that I believe could have a tangible impact on researchers in my region. The brainstorming sessions and collaborative work stood out as particularly productive and inspiring.\nAs a researcher from Argentina, I appreciated the opportunity to share my experiences and perspectives. One key takeaway was the importance of having participants from underrepresented regions in decision-making spaces. Solutions to our challenges must include our voices to be truly effective and relevant.\nI’m especially excited that the DISC Unconf 2025 will take place in São Paulo, Brazil. This move will bring more Latin American researchers to the table and foster regional collaboration."
