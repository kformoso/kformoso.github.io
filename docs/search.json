    "text": "The presentation “A Shiny App for Mapping Open-Science Communities, Organizations & Events in Latin America” highlighted the challenges of limited resources and spaces in Spanish for open science in Latin America, as well as the difficulty of identifying active communities and networks practicing open science in the region.\nIt emphasized the lack of a centralized, up-to-date repository to facilitate access to key information about resources, events, and communities, which hinders collaboration and knowledge exchange.\nAs a solution, the presentation proposed the development of a collaborative repository accessible through a Shiny application. This repository aims to centralize and map open science resources and communities in the region, enabling users to connect with local and regional initiatives, access resources, and actively participate in promoting open science practices.\nThe app is envisioned as not only a useful tool for researchers and organizations but also a bridge to foster collaboration and visibility for open science across Latin America.\nAn initial version can be found here.\nYou can find the presentation slides here."

To this end, we conducted an exploratory analysis of the evolution of the use of the terms “open science” and “open science” over time from 2012 to the present. Where information was available, the representation of each region was studied. Finally, a social network analysis was performed to identify influential users and clusters of users and then the association of these with communities of practice was studied.\nThe recording is available here.\nMore information can be found in this blogpost."

    "text": "Last week, I had the privilege of co-organizing a talk as part of the Buenos Aires chapter of R-Ladies, in collaboration with R en Buenos Aires. Together with María Nanton and Betsy Cohen, we showcased some incredible events and working groups we’ve been part of that not only offer formative experiences but also encourage active participation and community-building.\nOur goal was to inspire members of our community to apply and get involved in initiatives that promote personal and professional growth—and help strengthen our collective network. Many attendees shared that they were unfamiliar with some of the conferences and events we presented or didn’t realize they could apply for financial support or travel grants to participate. This realization was empowering for many, as it helped them see these opportunities as something within their reach.\nThe diversity in the room was amazing—we connected with people working in areas like census data, health data, and academic research. There were attendees who were just starting their journey with R, as well as seasoned users eager to share their experiences. The feedback we received was overwhelmingly positive, and the enthusiasm in the room reinforced the importance of creating spaces like this.\n\nWe wrapped up the evening with an end-of-year toast and a networking session, which allowed us to continue building connections in a relaxed and celebratory atmosphere. 🍾\nIf you missed the talk, you can check out the slides here: Slides\n💜 Stay connected with the R-Ladies Buenos Aires network: 🐦 Twitter: @RLadiesBA 🌐 Website: https://rladiesba.netlify.app/\nLet’s continue growing together, discovering opportunities, and making the R community an even more inclusive and enriching space! 💪💜"

    "text": "In September 2023, I had the opportunity to attend the NumFocus DISC Unconference—a gathering dedicated to creating a more equitable open-source data science community. As someone committed to promoting open practices in research, data, and scientific computing in Latin America, this event offered a unique space to connect with leaders in these fields and work together on meaningful projects.\nThe open-source community remains relatively homogenous, which limits its potential. Events like the DISC Unconf provide a space to brainstorm how to make it more representative and inclusve. My role at the event was as a contributor, and I focused on a project that resonates deeply with my experiences as a researcher from the global south: Knowhow: everything you wanted to know about applying for grants but didn’t ask."

    "text": "Knowhow: everything you wanted to know about applying for grants but didn’t ask\nThis project aimed to tackle a critical barrier faced by researchers from underrepresented regions when applying for grants from the global north. For many of us, the application process often feels foreign and inaccessible due to cultural and systemic differences. These challenges discourage talented researchers from applying, perpetuating inequality in access to resources.\nThe project’s goal was to design a curriculum and coaching program to support potential grantees in navigating the grant process. From identifying suitable funding opportunities to crafting proposals, creating budgets, and building collaborations, the program seeks to level the playing field and enable fairer engagement.\nI collaborated with an incredible team, including Laura Ación, Jessica Greene, Barbara Wilk, Kate Hertweck, Yo Yehudi, Tania Allard, and Mariana Meireles. Working alongside individuals from diverse backgrounds was inspiring. Their varied perspectives challenged my thinking and enriched the project in ways I hadn’t anticipated."

I met leaders in the open-source world, learned about initiatives making these communities more accessible, and participated in a project that I believe could have a tangible impact on researchers in my region. The brainstorming sessions and collaborative work stood out as particularly productive and inspiring.\nAs a researcher from Argentina, I appreciated the opportunity to share my experiences and perspectives. One key takeaway was the importance of having participants from underrepresented regions in decision-making spaces. Solutions to our challenges must include our voices to be truly effective and relevant.\nI’m especially excited that the DISC Unconf 2025 will take place in São Paulo, Brazil. This move will bring more Latin American researchers to the table and foster regional collaboration."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Earlier this month, I had the chance to attend Khipu, the largest Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning gathering in Latin America.\nThis year marked the fourth edition of Khipu—and the first to take place outside of Uruguay. It was held in Santiago, Chile, bringing together hundreds of researchers, professionals, and students from across the region and beyond.\nKhipu is more than just a conference: it’s a space for learning, sharing, and building community around AI in Latin America. The program is thoughtfully designed to offer content for a wide range of audiences. Talks follow a progressive structure: early sessions are more general and accessible, yet rigorous and engaging, and always led by experts.\nFor example, some of the opening lectures I really enjoyed were ML & DL Foundamentals I by Jorge Perez, ML & DL Foundamentals II by Alfredo Canziani and Natural Language Processing Fundamentals by Isabelle Augenstein. As the week went on, content became increasingly technical and specialized. On the second day, Petar Veličković gave a fantastic lecture on Geometric Deep Learning. By Thursday, we had parallel sessions on cybersecurity, ML in economics, computer vision, AI and human rights, among others.\nThe conference also offered tutorials at different difficulty levels on various topics such as in machine learning, natural language processing, AI ethics, or technical toolkits. Materials were carefully prepared, including well documented Jupyter notebooks you could take home and continue learning on your own. There were also poster sessions, where attendees could present their work and get feedback in a friendly environment.\nOne of the things that stood out the most to me was the welcoming and warm atmosphere. It’s a great place to meet people who are working in AI across different sectors, to explore collaborations, and to feel part of a growing Latin American AI community."

    "text": "✍️ Want to attend the next event?\nYou might be wondering how to attend the next Khipu. Unlike many conferences, you don’t simply register and pay a fee. Instead, you apply, sharing your background, motivation, and what you hope to contribute or learn. If selected, you can also apply for financial support to cover travel and accommodation. The goal is to make participation accessible and remove financial barriers.\nWhat makes a good application? I’m not entirely sure—maybe I should’ve asked someone from the organizing committee—but I believe they value your potential to share what you learn and act as a multiplier in your community. If you’re involved in teaching or in communities of practice, that’s probably a plus. If you’re working on projects that require AI and could benefit from your attendance, mention them! Include links to relevant resources or repositories."

    "text": "What I took with me\nI learned a lot, met incredible people, drank way too much coffee and ate way too much sugar. But most of all, what stayed with me was the human dimension: the limitations of current technologies, and how people reflect critically on them and work to overcome them.\nWhat happens when you’re working with sensitive, private data that can’t be shared with large models on external platforms, and your institution has limited infrastructure and funding? Projects like the ones presented by Leonardo Lombardi (QuantIT), Aiala Rosá (Universidad de la República), Victor Mireless (UNAM) and Juan Reutter (PUC, Chile) on AI and Human Rights are a clear example.\nWhat if you need a model whose decisions are understandable and accountable—like in a medical setting, where both doctor and patient should be able to understand the logic behind a diagnosis? Talks like the one by René Vidal (University of Pennsylvania) on explainability touched on that.\nOther sessions explored critical topics such as bias and AI governance, highlighting the importance of fairness and transparency in model development and deployment. As part of the closing event, Catherine D’Ignazio (MIT) and Ivana Feldgeber (DataGenero) delivered a powerful session on gender equity and women in AI.\nBasically, a reminder that AI, like any technology, is not neutral. It reflects the values, priorities, and perspectives of those who build it. That’s why spaces like Khipu matter: to ensure Latin America is not just a consumer of AI, but also a key player in shaping its future.\nYou can watch most of the talks on Khipu’s youtube channel"
